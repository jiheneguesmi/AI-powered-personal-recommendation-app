 ## Project Overview
The Eco-Friendly Personalized Tourism Application is a web-based platform aimed at enhancing the experience of tourists in Tunisia through personalized, AI-driven recommendations. This application considers user preferences, real-time data, and eco-friendly tourism practices to help users discover hidden gems, plan their journeys more effectively, and promote sustainable tourism in Tunisia.

Key Features
User Onboarding Form

Users enter their travel preferences, such as budget and type of tourism (e.g., cultural, religious, historical, natural).
Tailors recommendations to individual tastes and interests.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Cosine Similarity

The KNN algorithm matches user preferences with destinations in our dataset, suggesting the top three closest matches.
This ensures personalized recommendations based on proximity between user-specified characteristics and existing destination profiles.
Immersive Destination Exploration

Users receive detailed information on suggested destinations, including associated locations like restaurants, caf√©s, and attractions.
Reviews and ratings from other visitors provide an immersive experience, helping users make informed decisions.
Sentiment Analysis with Azure AI Language

Reviews are classified into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral.
Sentiment scores are calculated based on the proportion of positive reviews, helping users gauge the popularity and appeal of destinations.
User Profile Form

A secondary form gathers detailed user profile data, including age, gender, nationality, vacation type preference, budget, stay duration, preferred season, group size, and personal interests.
This information allows for even more refined recommendations, contributing to a tailored travel experience.
Activity Generation Using RAG and LLM Gemini

Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the LLM Gemini to dynamically generate activity suggestions based on individual profile characteristics.
Focuses on promoting eco-responsible and sustainable options to encourage environmentally-friendly tourism.
Real-Time Weather Forecasts

The platform provides up-to-date weather forecasts for each destination, helping users plan activities with local conditions in mind.
